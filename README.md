## Requirements

  Small Team, Big Impact

   We reach over 50 million monthly users and manage billions of data points with just 130 employees,
   which means we each have a direct impact on the health of our business and the end user. Our small
   size also means we're each expected to think two steps ahead at all times, stay on the bleeding
   edge of technology and make recommendations that drive product decisions.

  The best people, period

  Our teammates hail from the best schools and companies in the world, and we're not shy about investing
  in the continued growth of our employees with tuition reimbursement, peer learning and a substantial
  educational stipend. You won't find a weak link in our midst, because each and every one of us thrives
  on camaraderie, hard work and smart risks.
    ```

5. We need a list of a few things that makes WhitePages an awesome place to be an engineer:
  * Work on the latest technologies.
  * Work with engineers passionate about their craft.
  * Show your work to 50 million people a month.
  * Work in a fast moving, startup like environment.

6. We need to show what positions we are hiring for:

  Position        | Location     | Job
  ----------------|--------------|-----
  Web Developer   | Seattle, WA  | Design Genius
  Rails Engineer  | Seattle, WA  | Coding Rock Star
  UX Designer     | Seattle, WA  | User Advocate

7. Because we have such a diverse user base, we need to support IE8 and above.

8. We have provided a basic wireframe to get you started.  Design requirements have been annotated within the wireframe.

## What Now?
